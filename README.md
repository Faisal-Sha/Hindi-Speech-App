## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- PostgreSQL 16 or higher
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

#### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)

The entire application (frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database) can be run using Docker with just a few commands.

**Development Environment:**

1. **Copy the backend environment template and update any secrets:**
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```
   Edit `backend/.env` with your API keys and database credentials.

2. **Start all services with live-reload support:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```

3. **Visit the app:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3001
   - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
   - Database Admin (Adminer): http://localhost:8080

**Production Build:**

1. **Provide the required environment variables** (for example by exporting them or by creating a `.env` file next to the compose file). At minimum set `SERVER_NAME` to the public domain that will terminate TLS and the backend secrets described in `backend/.env.example`. 
   
   Example:
   ```env
   SERVER_NAME=voice.example.com
   FRONTEND_URL=https://voice.example.com
   DB_PASSWORD=super-secret
   DB_NAME=personal_assistant
   CERTBOT_RENEW_INTERVAL=12h # optional, defaults to 12 hours
   ```

2. **Request an initial TLS certificate** (only required once per domain). Replace the email and domain with your own values:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm certbot \
     certonly --webroot -w /var/www/certbot \
     -d "$SERVER_NAME" --email you@example.com --agree-tos --no-eff-email
   ```
   > **Note:** The nginx container serves a self-signed certificate until a real one is issued.

3. **Build and start the containers:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
   ```

4. **Access the application** at `https://$SERVER_NAME`. Port `80` remains open so Certbot can renew the certificate using the HTTP challenge.

**Stopping the Application:**

To stop the stack, use `docker compose ... down` with the same compose file that was used to start it:
```bash
# Development
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Production
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
```

> **Data Persistence:** The PostgreSQL data persists in the named Docker volume `postgres-data`, and TLS assets live in `certbot-certs`.

#### Option 2: Manual Installation

**Backend Setup:**
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Initialize database
psql -U postgres -f init-db.sql

# Start backend server
npm start
```

**Frontend Setup:**
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Access application at http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment Configuration

**Backend (.env):**
```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
