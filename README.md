A React-based voice assistant application designed for Hindi speakers. Built for my grandmother and anyone who prefers speaking in Hindi over typing.

Real-time Speech Display: See your words appear in real-time as you speak
Hindi Speech Recognition: Optimized for Hindi language input and output
AI Integration: Send your recorded speech to an AI assistant for responses
Text-to-Speech: Hear AI responses spoken back in Hindi
Conversation History: Keep track of your entire conversation

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js (version 14 or higher)
A modern web browser that supports Web Speech API (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
Microphone access

### Docker Setup

Run the entire application (frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database) using Docker.

#### Development environment

1. Copy the backend environment template and update any secrets:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```
2. Start all services with live-reload support:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```
3. Visit the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The backend API will be exposed on port `3001` and PostgreSQL on `5432`.

#### Production build

1. Provide the required environment variables (for example by exporting them or by creating a `.env` file next to the compose file). At minimum set `SERVER_NAME` to the public domain that will terminate TLS and the backend secrets described in `backend/.env.example`. Example:
   ```env
   SERVER_NAME=voice.example.com
   FRONTEND_URL=https://voice.example.com
   DB_PASSWORD=super-secret
   DB_NAME=personal_assistant
   CERTBOT_RENEW_INTERVAL=12h # optional, defaults to 12 hours
   ```
2. Request an initial TLS certificate (only required once per domain). Replace the email and domain with your own values:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm certbot \
     certonly --webroot -w /var/www/certbot \
     -d "$SERVER_NAME" --email you@example.com --agree-tos --no-eff-email
   ```
   The nginx container serves a self-signed certificate until a real one is issued.
3. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
   ```
4. Access the application at `https://$SERVER_NAME`. Port `80` remains open so Certbot can renew the certificate using the HTTP challenge.

To stop the stack use `docker compose ... down` with the same compose file that was used to start it. The PostgreSQL data persists in the named Docker volume `postgres-data`, and TLS assets live in `certbot-certs`.

### Manual setup

Install dependencies
  npm install

Start the frontend
  npm start


Backend Setup
This app requires a backend server to process AI requests. Create a simple Express.js server:

  cd hindi-voice-backend
  npm init -y

Install backend dependencies
  npm install express cors

Start the backend
  node server.js
